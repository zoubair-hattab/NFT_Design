## Responsive NFT Design

In this project, we have initiated the development of a responsive design NFT using React.js, CSS, and React-icons. While there is existing content on the internet related to this project, it primarily focuses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my approach, I aimed to implement this project using React.js, ensuring that I maintain consistency with the original design's colors.

Moving forward, the next step involves integrating a backend to interact with this design through a smart contract. I plan to achieve this by utilizing either Ether.js or Web3.js. As for the CSS components, I have incorporated various features such as linear gradients, animations, shadows, and transformations, sometimes on the X-axis and other times on the Y-axis. To ensure responsiveness, I avoided using Tailwind CSS and opted for a more manual approach. My objective is to enhance my CSS skills by incorporating advanced features, and media queries, and adhering to a mobile-first approach in the design, providing a solid foundation for future developments.
